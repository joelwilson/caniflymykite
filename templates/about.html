<h2>What</h2>
<p><em>Can I Kly my Kite</em> is a tool for kite fliers to quickly and easily determine if it is "weathery" enough outside to fly. Nothing else is as easy, painless, and to the point!</p>

<h2>How</h2>
<p>We are state-of-the-art! Weather data comes straight from the <em>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</em>. Location info is pulled from Geonames. The whole thing is pieced together with vanilla HTML and CSS and backed up with a Python core.</p>

<p>Why not <a href="https://github.com/elbinray/caniflymykite" target="_blank">Check out the code</a>?</p>

<h2>Who</h2>
<p>I created <em>Can I Fly my Kite</em> as a personal learning experience. Check me out on <a href="http://twitter.com/joel_wilson" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/elbinray" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
